# FIX2AN Backend

This folder is a scaffold for a future standalone backend (e.g., Node/Express, NestJS, or similar).

## Status

- Not implemented yet. The current application still uses Next.js API routes located in `../frontend/src/app/api`.

## Suggested Next Steps

- Choose a backend framework (Express/Nest/Fastify)
- Initialize the server in `src/index.js`
- Define API routes equivalent to the current Next.js API routes
- (Optionally) move `prisma/` and database access code from `../frontend` into `backend/`
- Configure CORS/proxy from the frontend to this backend
